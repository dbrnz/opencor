        <p>
            The following limitations have been observed while using OpenCOR on our <a href="supportedPlatforms.html">supported platforms</a>. They may apply to you, or not, depending on the platform you use and your specific circumstances.
        </p>

        <div class="section">
            Windows, Linux and OS X
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>By default, OpenCOR uses your system's language for menus, dialog boxes, etc., as long as it is either English or French (please <a href="contactUs.html">contact us</a> if you would like OpenCOR to support other languages). If your system uses another language, then OpenCOR will default to English. Otherwise, if you specifically specify English or French, then please be aware that system messages, dialog boxes, etc. will still be displayed using your system's language (assuming it is not one of the languages supported by OpenCOR).</li>
            <li>
                OpenCOR uses the <a href="http://cellml-api.sourceforge.net/">CellML API</a>, which is known to have the following limitations:
                <ul>
                    <li>It will crash OpenCOR if you try to export a CellML file to a user-defined format that is described in a file that contains valid, but unknown, XML.</li>
                    <li>It may incorrectly (in)validate certain CellML files.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            Windows
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>OpenCOR's <a href="plugins/organisation/FileBrowserWindow.html">FileBrowserWindow</a> plugin may, on some systems, result in OpenCOR being slow to respond at startup. This has nothing to do with OpenCOR, but most likely something to do with a Windows shell add-on that is installed on your system. <a href="http://www.brighthub.com/computing/windows-platform/articles/86552.aspx">This page</a> may help you address the issue, but if not then you might have to unselect the FileBrowserWindow plugin.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            Linux
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>Upon starting, the position of the main window may be slightly different from the one in your previous session. This is due to a lack of compliancy between window managers on Linux. So, if you can, try another window manager.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section">
            OS X
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>If you run a simulation on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), then the first time you use a particular version of a solver, the simulation will be 'slow'. However, subsequent runs will be 'fast'. It looks like it might have nothing to do with OpenCOR since all simulations are 'fast' on Windows and Linux, as well as on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) and OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).</li>
        </ul>
